Han. “ 1'11 trust Silanu53 but forbid it, Clio,
“ My fame be forced to beg its bread from Rome !
“My ghost would scarcely know myself so handled.
“A monster, first, of cruelty, and next7
“ A blunderer after Cannae. Then for Capua—
“ The luxury we all did live in there!
“What a pet theme for moralists !''
